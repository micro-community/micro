## Programming the Real World


+ Micro is an API first distributed cloud operating system built for real world programming.


## About

Micro addresses the key requirements for building services in the cloud. It leverages the microservices
architecture pattern and provides a set of services which act as the building blocks of a platform. Micro deals
with the complexity of distributed systems and provides simpler programmable abstractions to build on.
